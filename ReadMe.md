This file includes source code for functions that perform a quick approximation of the
square root of the number sent to the functions. This approximation is quicker than 
standard squareroot function in at least first 500k whole numbers as ascertained in 
initial tests and approximated to less than 0.2% error after 1 iteration of Newton's
Method of root approximation.
